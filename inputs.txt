Requirements:

files:
- weight maps
- motion parameters
- func2anat affine
- anat2standard warp
- mask

values:
- tr

resources:
- csf mask in MNI space
- non-brain mask in MNI space
- edge(?) mask in MNI space
  - This is key. We need to create this in native space.

steps:
1. Run ICA on preprocessed data with MELODIC
  - Uses --mmthresh (mixture modeling based inference)
2. Register ICA weight maps to MNI using aff and warp
3. Compute spatial features
4. Compute time series features
5. Compute frequency features
